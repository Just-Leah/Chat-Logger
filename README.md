# Chat-Logger

A python script to separate chat in a Minecraft log

## Requirements

- Minecraft (duh)
- Python (any version, should probably get the latest one to not cause problems)
- If you have windows you can just open the batch file, there is currently no ease of access for other platforms, but if you open a pull request you could help with one.
